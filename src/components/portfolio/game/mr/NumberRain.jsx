                The objective of the project was to create our own version of the game <a

                manage the Canvas to create the UI, and implement a saving system with JSON files learned through
                this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUi9aijvpgs" target="_blank" className={"font-bold"}>tutorial</a>.<br/>

                have back then.
