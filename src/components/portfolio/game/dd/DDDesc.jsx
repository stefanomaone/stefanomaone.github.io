            "Dumby Dumblings" is the first group project
            I participated in during the DBGA course, with the objective of developing a HyperCasual game.
            The aim of the game is to defend the island at the center of the map from enemy ships trying to reach it and
            steal its treasure.
            The player's ship rotates around the island on a fixed path. The player must decide when to attack an enemy
            ship or focus on
            defending the island from boarding attempts.<br/>
            <p className={"mb-1 mt-1 font-bold"}>
                At the time of writing, I am in contact with some team members to create a new project.
