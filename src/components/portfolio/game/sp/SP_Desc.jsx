            The Shattered Peak was the very first project I had the chance to develop in Unreal Engine.
            Our team was tasked with creating a survival game, and we chose a horror style: the character
            is a child who must face a storm descending on his mountain home. While searching for his missing parents,
            a mysterious creature pursues him through the night. Having the opportunity to use such a powerful engine,
            exploring the vast world of plugins and libraries like Metahuman and Quixel Bridge, was incredible.
            Working in a team with people more experienced than me and learning valuable insights from them was a
            fantastic experience that I canâ€™t wait to repeat
        </p>
