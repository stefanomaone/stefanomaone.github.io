            Hi, I am Stefano!
            I am passionate about cinema, computer science, and, above all, video games, which encapsulate the essence of my interests.
            For me, programming is an opportunity for personal growth and continuous learning.
            I love teamwork, as the exchange of ideas and perspectives is essential for the success of any project.
            I recently completed the game programming course at DBGA Academy, where I had the opportunity to collaborate in team using Unity and Unreal Engine.
